                            For generations, the lemonade stand has been a child's first foray into enterprise. It's was fun, creative, and sometimes profitable. It's what every job or business should be. YOUR Lemonade Stand is what we want to help YOU build.</p><br>

                    		EVERYTHING in life (being a student, a parent, a teacher, a factory worker or businessmen) is entrepreneurial, requiring creativity, ingenuity, and a positive attitude, whether it's ask a parent for money for the movies or building an empire.</p>
                            <p align="left"  style="color: black; padding: 0px 66px;">
                            Entrepreneurship is the crossroads where both the college bound and boundless meet. Learning and creativity is the common denominator. The college bound may pursue app development, robotics, etc. while the “career now” may learn trades that leads to business advancement and business opportunities. The trades (cooking, plumbing, carpentry, etc.) lead to entrepreneurship, financial and societal independence. Even applying for the most rudimentary job will be enhanced with ingenuity and creativity. While the challenges are great, the possibilities are greater that we might empower even one young person to reach AND grasp a future that inspires their friends, families, and communities to learn, thrive, build, invent, employ, and share success.</p>
                            <p align="left"  style="color: black; padding: 0px 66px;">
                            We value integrity, opportunity, responsibility, and community and that dignity, pride, and respect can be found in all work.</p><br>

                <p align="left" style="padding: 0px 66px;color:black;">&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<i>Sam Bornholdt</i> (1914-2007) was described as a Baptist Gandhi truck driver who profoundly influenced the lives of over 30 young people in his life through encouragement, matchmaking, job opportunities, spiritual direction, but always with unconditional love. While Sam's 2 best friends had PhDs, Sam never felt confidence about his education or his career. If Sam had been given that dignity, he may have profoundly influenced the lives of 1000s of young people. The lesson of Sam is that every child matters and can make a difference in the lives of others. </p>
                <p align="left" style="padding: 0px 66px;color:black;">&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<i>Students</i>! It’s hard not to walk into a classroom without smiling. Bright eyes, big smiles, always great questions. It is impossible NOT to feel inspired for our future.</p>

                Society’s one-size-fits-all aphorism of "go to college at all cost" has lead to $1.4 trillion in student loan debt, high school dropout rates of 25% (45% for colleges), higher crime (75% of all crimes are committed by high school dropouts), wage stagnation, outsourced manufacturing, an erosion of the middle class, political disenfranchisement and loss of respect for unions, trades, laborers, farming and craftsmanship. If nothing is done, the consequences are high. Economic and political malaise may remain while 25 million high paying, “middle-skilled” jobs will go unfulfilled in the coming decade.</p>
