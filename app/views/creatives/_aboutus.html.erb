                                    Described as a Baptist Gandhi truck driver, Sam profoundly influenced the lives of over thirty young people in his life through encouragement, matchmaking, job opportunities and spiritual direction, but always with unconditional love. While Sam's two best friends had PhDs, Sam never felt confident about his education or his career. If he had, who knows how many thousands of young people may have benefited from his influence? The lesson of Sam is that every child matters and can make a difference in the lives of others. </p>
